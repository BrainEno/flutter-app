# cmd info
The configured version of Java detected may conflict with the Gradle version in your new Flutter app.

To keep the default AGP version Gradle version 8.3, download a compatible Java version
(Java 17 <= (Java 17 <= compatible Java version < Java 21) Java version < Java 21). Configure this Java version
globally for Flutter by running:

  flutter config --jdk-dir=<JDK_DIRECTORY>


Alternatively, to continue using your configured Java version, update the Gradle
version specified in the following file to a compatible Gradle version (compatible Gradle version range: 8.4 - 8.7):
F:\flutter\belog\android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties

You may also update the Gradle version used by running
`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=<COMPATIBLE_GRADLE_VERSION>`.

See
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html#java for details
on compatible Java/Gradle versions, and see
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:upgrading_wrapper
for more details on using the Gradle Wrapper command to update the Gradle version
used.
